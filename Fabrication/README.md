## Part 2: Materials

### Water Storage
- [Aquarium](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 6" x 11" x 8" (HxWxD) and 3/16" wall thickness
- [Water Tank](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 5" x 11" x 11" (HxWxD) and 1/4" wall thickness

The aquarium where the miniature apartment is placed is at a 1:20 scale to my real apartment. Therefore, I had the encasings custom-made to size at ShopPOPDisplays (linked above). 

### Water System

<img src="/../main/Pictures/PlumbinSketch.jpg" alt="Picture illustrating the plumbing of Flooded House." width="500">

As shown in the illustration above, there are two water pumps: one pumps water from the water tank into the aquarium, and one pumps water out of the aquarium back into the water tank. The plumbing is made waterproof using several different water tank connectors listed below. Two holes are drilled into the underside of the aquarium to fit the water tank connectors. These holes can either be laser-cut (see Part 4: Laser Cutting) or drilled with a large acrylic drill bit.

- [Silicone Tubing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W5TGX8B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) 1/4" Inner Diameter
- Two [Water Tank Connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GPP23K9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) and two [Hose fitting adapters](https://www.harfington.com/products/p-1114801?variant=42673303945465) to connect the water pump to the aquarium
- Two [L-Bulkhead fittings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J86HS2W?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to connect the water tank to the water pump

## Part 3: 3D printing
[Find 3D Models here](/Fabrication/3D%20Printing)

All 3D models are provided as .stl files either in mm or cm units. Scale accordingly in your preferred 3D printing software. The _Electronics Housing_ and the _Water Tank Walls_ are printed in black filament. The _Spacers_ that hold the aquarium top are printed in transparent filament. The _Interface_ is printed in two colors: black and white, so that the text and map appear in white in the print, and the background appears in black.

## Part 4: Laser Cutting
[Find Illustrator Files here](/Fabrication/Laser%20Cutting)

The _Acrylic Aquarium Top_ is laser-cut in 1/8" thickness transparent acrylic.

## Part 5: Miniature Items

The miniature items inside the aquarium are fabricated from an array of different materials, including painted clay, wood, metal, and fabric. All items are a direct replica of my own furniture and personal items, at a scale of 1:20. Here are some pictures of what my miniature items look like:
