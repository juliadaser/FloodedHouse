## Part 2: Materials

### Water Storage
- [Aquarium](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 6" x 11" x 8" (HxWxD) and 3/16" wall thickness - $79.28
- [Water Tank](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 5" x 11" x 11" (HxWxD) and 1/4" wall thickness - $86.92

The aquarium size where the miniature apartment is placed in, is in a 1:20 scale to my real apartment. Therefore, I had the encasings custom-made to size at ShopPOPDisplays (linked above). 

### Water System
- [Silicone Tubing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W5TGX8B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) 1/4" Inner Diameter
- Two [Water Tank Connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GPP23K9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) and two [Hose fitting adaptors](https://www.harfington.com/products/p-1114801?variant=42673303945465) to connect the water pump to the aquarium
- Two [L-Bulkhead fittings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J86HS2W?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to connect the water tank to the water pump
