## Part 2: Materials

### Water Storage
- [Aquarium](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 6" x 11" x 8" (HxWxD) and 3/16" wall thickness
- [Water Tank](https://www.shoppopdisplays.com/CS001/5-sided-clear-acrylic-box-custom-size.html?list=Category%20Listing) in size 5" x 11" x 11" (HxWxD) and 1/4" wall thickness

The aquarium size where the miniature apartment is placed in, is in a 1:20 scale to my real apartment. Therefore, I had the encasings custom-made to size at ShopPOPDisplays (linked above). 

### Water System
- [Silicone Tubing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W5TGX8B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) 1/4" Inner Diameter
- Two [Water Tank Connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GPP23K9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) and two [Hose fitting adaptors](https://www.harfington.com/products/p-1114801?variant=42673303945465) to connect the water pump to the aquarium
- Two [L-Bulkhead fittings](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J86HS2W?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to connect the water tank to the water pump

## Part 3: 3D printing
[Find 3D Models here](/Fabrication/3D%20Printing)

All 3D models are provided as .stl files either in mm or cm units. Scale accordingly in your preferred 3D print software. 
The _Electronics Housing_ and the _Water Tank Walls_ are printed in black filament. The _Spacers_ that hold the aquarium top are printed in transparent filament. The _Interface_ is printed in two colors, black and white, so that the text and map appear in white in the print, and the background appears in black. 

## Part 4: Laser Cutting
[Find Illustrator Files here](/Fabrication/Laser%20Cutting)

The _Acrylic Aquarium Top_ is lasercut in 1/8" thickness transparent acrylic. 

## Part 5: Miniature Items

The miniature items inside the aquarium are fabricated from an array of different materials, including painted clay, wood, metal, and fabric. 
All items are a direct replica of my own furniture and personal items, in a scale of 1:20. Here are some pictures of what my miniature items look like:
