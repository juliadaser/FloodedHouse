## Part 1: Overview

- Sketch of electronics that is annotated (and what each part does)

The electronic components in Flooded House have three main functions:
- **_The Interface_** collects the user's selection of the climate scenario. The selectin contains 6 buttons - each one represents a location around the world, potentiometer with which users can select a year, and a potentiometer with which users can select a predicted temperature increase. A "Enter" button allows users to start the visualization.
- **_The Water Height Measurement_** consists of many transistors and constantly measures the water height inside the aquarium tp report it back to the Arduino. [The electronics for this are not very elegant unfortunately...]
- **_The Water System_**, made up of water pumps, transistors, and capacitors pump water into the aquarium or out of it, depending on the user selection, and the water height.
