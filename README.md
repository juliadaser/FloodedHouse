All files, code, and data used to build _**Flooded House**_.

Art is for all! This GitHub page provides insight into my building process, and includes all files and code to make _Flooded House_ as transparent as possible. This is especially important because _Flooded House_ is a data visualization about climate change - a topic where accuracy and transparency are crucial.
